CHANGELOG Version 2.6 (MiB)

"dsh, pcp, dvt":
The tools "dsh, pcp, dvt" have been modified to allow the selection of the clusterfile containing
servergroup-definitions not only be the environment variable CLUSTER, they also look for
a file "clusterit" in the working directory and/or a file pointed to by commandline option "-c clusterfile".
To have this option consistent, the following 2 options had to be renamed for command "pcp":
-c "concurrent" was renamed to -p "parallel", and
-p "preserve file mode" was renamed to -k "keep file mode" 

Order in which a "clusterfile" containing servergroup-definitions is searched for:
1. given by commandline option "-c<clusterfile>"
2. file "clusterit" in the current working directory
3. file pointed to by environment variable "CLUSTER"

The programs "dsh", "pcp" and "dvt" accept individual port numbers when connecting via SSH.
The clusterfile may contain servernames as follows: 
GROUP:servers
servername1
servername2:portnumber1
servername3:portnumber2

This does not work for servernames given on the commandline via options "-w" or "-x". 

"dsh"
Added option "-S <separator>" to enable the selection of a different (or no) separating character
between the hostnames and the resulting output. Might be useful for the creation of CSV-files.

"barrier"
Changed option "-q" (=revert quiet-mode) to "-d" (=debug)

"barrierd"
Write statusmessages via syslog. Daemon logs number of servers to syncronize for given key as follows:
Jan 17 21:16:49 tosh barrierd[25152]: [ID 422220 daemon.info] got key test from 127.0.0.1 (1 of 2)
Jan 17 21:16:59 tosh barrierd[25152]: [ID 422220 daemon.info] got key test from 127.0.0.1 (2 of 2)
Jan 17 21:16:59 tosh barrierd[25152]: [ID 180927 daemon.info] synced 2 nodes with key: test
